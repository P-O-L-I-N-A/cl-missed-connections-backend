User Stories:

1.  As a user I would like to sign up, in, out and change password.
2.  As a user I would like to input the attributes of my missed connection and
    see if anyone had been searching for me.
3.  As a user I would like to create a missed connection and add it to the database
    so that other users can see if I had been searching for them.

Technologies Used: Javascript, jQuery, Ruby on Rails, Heroku, Github

My project idea is a dating app that utilizes Craigslist Missed Connections.

While perusing Craigslist Missed Connections I noticed similarities in all the
posts, such as location, hair color, action, etc., and wondered if there could be
an easier way of searching this database to see if someone had been searching
for you.

The success rate of Missed Connections is abysmally low -- I'd like to increase it.

Those who would use this app are people who have had a lovely encounter with a
stranger and would like to know if that stranger is searching for them too.

This app is still in development. Right now a user is unable to search the
database of 'Lonelies' to see if someone else had posted about them. I've created
the button and the form field for the comparison however, I've commented it out until I
can figure out the logic. Figuring out the logic of the comparison will be challenging
but not impossible.
